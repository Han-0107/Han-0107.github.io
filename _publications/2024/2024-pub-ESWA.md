  We propose an Integration of Individual and Collaborative Abilities based Dynamic Worker Selection (IICA-DWS) algorithm to recruit excellent workers as a team in a high-quality and low-cost style. In the IICA-DWS algorithm, each workerâ€™s individual ability and collaborative contribution to the team are evaluated more accurately using the Approximate Shapley Value (ASV). In addition, a high-quality team formation method is established to complete complex tasks at low cost. This involves the selection of both team leaders and team members. In this process, the Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) model is adopted to dynamically select excellent workers using exploration and exploitation phases. Lastly, the IICA-DWS algorithm is evaluated through theoretical analysis and experimental results.
