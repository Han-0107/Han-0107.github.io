short_bio: | 
  Hi! I am Yunrui Zhang (Âº†Ëä∏Áùø), an incoming ECE Ph.D. student at Cornell University. I obtained my bachelor's degree at Tsinghua University, where I was very fortunate to be advised by Prof. Gangtie Zheng, Prof. Mingguo Zhao and Prof. Rebing Wu. <br>
  My research interests lie broadly in the intersection of machine learning and advanced healthcare, including Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)üß†, multi-modal medical imaging and surgical roboticsü¶æ. <br>
  During my leisure time, I am an enthusiast of classic Chinese literature & poetry üìú, fiction üìñ, piano üéπ and musicals üé∂.
