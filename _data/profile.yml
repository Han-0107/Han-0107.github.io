  <p>Hi! I am Yaohui Han (韩耀辉), an incoming Ph.D. student at <a href="https://www.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/">Department of Computer Science and Engineering</a>, <a href="https://www.cuhk.edu.hk/chinese/index.html">Chinese University of Hong Kong</a>, under the supervision of <a href="https://tsungyiho.github.io/">Prof. Tsung-Yi Ho</a>. Currently, I am very fortunate to be co-supervised by <a href="https://mypage.cuhk.edu.cn/academics/chentinghuan/">Prof. Tinghuan Chen</a>. Before this, I obtained my bachelor's degree at <a href="https://www.csu.edu.cn/">Central South University</a>, where I was advised by <a href="https://faculty.csu.edu.cn/anfengliu/zh_CN/index.htm">Prof. Anfeng Liu</a>. In 2021, I obtained my high school diploma at <a href="https://www.neyc.cn/">Northeast Yucai School</a> in Shenyang.</p>
  <p>During the past years, I have actively participated in several projects and competitions. This gave me strong problem-solving skills. Currently, my research interest is <a href="https://ai4eda.github.io/">AI for EDA</a> and other <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Applications_of_artificial_intelligence">AI Applications</a>. I am always looking for potential collaboration opportunities. If you have any idea on research in related fields, please feel free to contact me!</p>
  <p>During my leisure time, I am also an enthusiast of basketball&#x1F3C0;, badminton&#x1F3F8;, racing&#x1F3CE; and astronomy&#x1F52D;, and always willing to try new things.</p>
