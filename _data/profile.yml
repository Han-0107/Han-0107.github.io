  <p>Hi! I am Yaohui Han (韩耀辉), an incoming Ph.D. student at Chinese University of Hong Kong, advised by <a href="https://tsungyiho.github.io/">Prof. Tsung-Yi Ho</a>. I obtained my bachelor degree at Central South University, where I was very fortunate to be advised by <a href="https://faculty.csu.edu.cn/anfengliu/zh_CN/index.htm">Prof. Anfeng Liu</a> and <a href="https://faculty.csu.edu.cn/dingjiafeng/zh_CN/index.htm">Prof. Jiafeng Ding</a>. In addition, <a href="https://mypage.cuhk.edu.cn/academics/chentinghuan/">Prof. Tinghuan Chen</a> and <a href="https://www.yuzhe-ma.com/">Prof. Yuzhe Ma</a> trusted my capability and led me to do more research selflessly.</p>
  <p>During the past years, I have actively participated in several projects and competitions. This gave me strong problem-solving skills. Currently, my research interests include <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_design_automation">Electronic Design Automation (EDA)</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence">Artificial Intelligence (AI)</a>.</p>
