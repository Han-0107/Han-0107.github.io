  <p>Hi! I am Yaohui Han (韩耀辉), an incoming Ph.D. student at <a href="https://www.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/">Departmanet of Computer Science and Engineering</a>, <a href="https://www.cuhk.edu.hk/chinese/index.html">Chinese University of Hong Kong</a>, under the supervision of <a href="https://tsungyiho.github.io/">Prof. Tsung-Yi Ho</a>. Before this, I obtained my bachelor's degree at Central South University, where I was very fortunate to be advised by <a href="https://faculty.csu.edu.cn/anfengliu/zh_CN/index.htm">Prof. Anfeng Liu</a> and <a href="https://faculty.csu.edu.cn/dingjiafeng/zh_CN/index.htm">Prof. Jiafeng Ding</a>.</p>
  <p>During the past years, I have actively participated in several projects and competitions. This gave me strong problem-solving skills. Currently, my research interests include <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_design_automation">Electronic Design Automation</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence">Artificial Intelligence</a>. I am always looking for potential collaboration opportunities. If you have any idea on research in related fields, please feel free to contact me!</p>
  <p>During my leisure time, I am also an enthusiast of basketball&#x1F3C0;, astronomy&#x1F52D; and photography&#x1F4F7;.</p>
