short_bio:
  "Hi! I am Yunrui Zhang (张芸睿), an incoming ECE Ph.D. student at Cornell University. I obtained my bachelor's degree at Tsinghua University, where I was very fortunate to be advised by Prof. Gangtie Zheng, Prof. Mingguo Zhao and Prof. Rebing Wu. \n
  My research interests lie broadly in the intersection of machine learning and advanced healthcare, including Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), multi-modal medical imaging and surgical robotics. \n
  Throughout my undergraduate studies, I have always been actively involved in scientific research, exploring a variety of fields. Please feel free to continue scrolling down this page to see more of my research! \n
  During my leisure time, I am an enthusiast of classic Chinese literature & poetry 📜, contemporary fiction 📖, piano 🎹 and musicals 🎶. "
